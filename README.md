headless_crashplan
==================

Bash script and configuration files to make it easy to switch between managing CrashPlan locally and on a headless server.

This script is based on this (http://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/how_to/configure_a_headless_client) support article.

The script is written for managing CrashPlan engines from OS X but could easily be adapted for other platforms.  The script could be improved by managing the required SSL tunnel as well but as it currently stands I'm happy.
