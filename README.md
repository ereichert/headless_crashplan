headless_crashplan
==================

05/30/2016 - Updated for CrashPlan 4.7

Bash script and configuration files to make it easy to switch between managing CrashPlan locally (on OS X) and on a headless server.

This script is based on this (https://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/4/Configuring/Using_CrashPlan_On_A_Headless_Computer) support article.

The script is written for managing CrashPlan engines from OS X but could easily be adapted for other platforms.  The script could be improved by managing the required SSL tunnel as well but as it currently stands I'm happy.
